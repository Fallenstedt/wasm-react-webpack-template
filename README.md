# Rust WebAssembly React Template
![Template Test & Build](https://github.com/Fallenstedt/wasm-react-webpack-template/workflows/Template%20Test%20&%20Build/badge.svg)

A slightly opinionated webpack build to start your next wasm project. 

## Setup

A simple 'yarn' and 'yarn start' should do the trick. File an issue if it doesn't!

`src` is where your rust code can go. `js` is where you can find your react :)
