# Rust WebAssembly React Template

A slightly opinionated webpack build to start your next wasm project. 

## Setup

A simple 'yarn' and 'yarn start' should do the trick. File an issue if it doesn't!

`src` is where your rust code can go. `js` is where you can find your react :) 

TODO write instructions to setup with `cargo generate`
